Libpng 1.2.8beta5 - November 20, 2004

This is not intended to be a public release.  It will be replaced
within a few weeks by a public version or by another test version.

Changes since the last public release (1.2.7):

  Fixed bug in png_text_compress() that would fail to complete a large block.
version 1.2.8beta1 [November 1, 2004]
  Fixed bug, introduced in libpng-1.2.7, that overruns a buffer during
    strip alpha operation in png_do_strip_filler().
  Added PNG_1_2_X definition in pngconf.h
  #ifdef out png_info_init in png.c and png_read_init in pngread.c (as of 1.3.0)
version 1.2.8beta2 [November 2, 2004]
  Reduce color_type to a nonalpha type after strip alpha operation in
    png_do_strip_filler().
version 1.2.8beta3 [November 3, 2004]
  Revised definitions of PNG_MAX_UINT_32, PNG_MAX_SIZE, and PNG_MAXSUM
version 1.2.8beta4 [November 12, 2004]
  Fixed (again) definition of PNG_LIBPNG_VER_DLLNUM in png.h (Cosmin).
  Added PNG_LIBPNG_BUILD_PRIVATE in png.h (Cosmin).
  Set png_ptr->zstream.data_type to Z_BINARY, to avoid unnecessary detection
    of data type in deflate (Cosmin).
  Deprecated but continue to support SPECIALBUILD and PRIVATEBUILD in favor of
    PNG_LIBPNG_BUILD_SPECIAL_STRING and PNG_LIBPNG_BUILD_PRIVATE_STRING.
version 1.2.8beta5 [November 20, 2004]
  Use png_ptr->flags instead of png_ptr->transformations to pass
    PNG_STRIP_ALPHA info to png_do_strip_filler(), to preserve ABI
    compatibility.
  Revised handling of SPECIALBUILD, PRIVATEBUILD, 
    PNG_LIBPNG_BUILD_SPECIAL_STRING and PNG_LIBPNG_BUILD_PRIVATE_STRING.
