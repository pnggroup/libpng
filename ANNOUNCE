Changes since the last public release (1.6.22):

Version 1.6.23beta01 [May 29, 2016]
  Stop a potential memory leak in png_set_tRNS() (Bug report by Ted Ying).
  Fixed the progressive reader to handle empty first IDAT chunk properly
    (patch by Timothy Nikkel).  This bug was introduced in libpng-1.6.0 and
    only affected the libpng16 branch.
  Added tests in pngvalid.c to check zero-length IDAT chunks in various
    positions.  Fixed the sequential reader to handle these more robustly
    (John Bowler).
