Changes since the last public release (1.5.7):

Version 1.6.0beta01 [December 15, 2011]
  Removed machine-generated configure files from the GIT repository (they will
    continue to appear in the tarball distributions).
  Restored the new 'simplified' API, which was deleted from libpng-1.5.7.
  Added example programs for the new 'simplified' API.
  Added ANSI-C (C90) headers and require them, and take advantage of the
    change. Also fixed some of the projects/* and contrib/* files that needed
    updates for libpng16 and the move of pngvalid.c.
    With this change the required ANSI-C header files are assumed to exist: the
    implementation must provide float.h, limits.h, stdarg.h and stddef.h and
    libpng relies on limits.h and stddef.h existing and behaving as defined
    (the other two required headers aren't used).  Non-ANSI systems that don't
    have stddef.h or limits.h will have to provide an appropriate fake
    containing the relevant types and #defines.
  The use of FAR/far has been eliminated and the definition of png_alloc_size_t
    is now controlled by a flag so that 'small size_t' systems can select it
    if necessary.  Libpng 1.6 may not currently work on such systems -- it
    seems likely that it will ask 'malloc' for more than 65535 bytes with any
    image that has a sufficiently large row size (rather than simply failing
    to read such images).
  New tools directory containing tools used to generate libpng code.
  Fixed race conditions in parallel make builds. With higher degrees of
    parallelism during 'make' the use of the same temporary file names such
    as 'dfn*' can result in a race where a temporary file from one arm of the
    build is deleted or overwritten in another arm.  This changes the
    temporary files for suffix rules to always use $* and ensures that the
    non-suffix rules use unique file names.

Version 1.6.0beta02 [December 17, 2011]
  Added pngconfig.h file.  This indirect reference to config.h avoids
    problems with build scripts that search for config.h and find an
    inappropriate one in the standard paths.
