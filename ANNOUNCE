Changes since the last public release (1.6.6):

Version 1.6.7 [September 21, 2013]
  Revised unknown chunk code to correct several bugs in the NO_SAVE_/NO_WRITE
    combination
  Allow HANDLE_AS_UNKNOWN to work when other options are configured off. Also
    fixed the pngminim makefiles to work when $(MAKEFLAGS) contains stuff
    which terminates the make options (as by default in recent versions of
    Gentoo).
