Changes since the last public release (1.6.7):

Version 1.6.8beta01 [November 18, 2013]
  Changed #ifdef PNG_HANDLE_AS_UNKNOWN_SUPPORTED in pngpread.c to
    #ifdef PNG_SET_UNKNOWN_CHUNKS_SUPPORTED to be consistent with
    what is in pngpriv.h.
  Moved prototype for png_handle_unknown() in pngpriv.h outside of
    the #ifdef PNG_SET_UNKNOWN_CHUNKS_SUPPORTED/#endif block.
