Libpng 1.0.5s - February 18, 2000

This is not intended to be a public release.  It will be replaced
within a few weeks by a public version or by another test version.

Changes since the last public release (1.0.5):

version libpng-1.0.5a October 23, 1999
  Added contrib/pngsuite and contrib/pngminus (Willem van Schaik)
  Fixed a typo in the png_set_sRGB() function call in example.c (Jan Nijtmans)
  Further optimization and bugfix of pngvcrd.c
  Revised pngset.c so that it does not allocate or free memory in the user's
    text_ptr structure.  Instead, it makes its own copy.
  Created separate write_end_info_struct in pngtest.c for a more severe test.
  Added code in pngwrite.c to free info_ptr->text[i].key to stop a memory leak.
version libpng-1.0.5b November 23, 1999
  Moved PNG_FLAG_HAVE_CHUNK_HEADER, PNG_FLAG_BACKGROUND_IS_GRAY and
    PNG_FLAG_WROTE_tIME from flags to mode.
  Added png_write_info_before_PLTE() function.
  Fixed some typecasting in contrib/gregbook/*.c
  Updated scripts/makevms.com and added makevms.com to contrib/gregbook
    and contrib/pngminus (Martin Zinser)
version libpng-1.0.5c November 26, 1999
  Moved png_get_header_version from png.h to png.c, to accomodate ansi2knr.
  Removed all global arrays (according to PNG_NO_GLOBAL_ARRAYS macro), to
    accomodate making DLL's: Moved usr_png_ver from global variable to function
    png_get_header_ver() in png.c.  Moved png_sig to png_sig_bytes in png.c and
    eliminated use of png_sig in pngwutil.c.  Moved the various png_CHNK arrays
    into pngtypes.h.  Eliminated use of global png_pass arrays.  Declared the
    png_CHNK and png_pass arrays to be "const".  Made the global arrays
    available to applications (although none are used in libpng itself) when
    PNG_NO_GLOBAL_ARRAYS is not defined or when PNG_GLOBAL_ARRAYS is defined.
  Removed some extraneous "-I" from contrib/pngminus/makefile.std
  Changed the PNG_sRGB_INTENT macros in png.h to be consistent with PNG-1.2.
  Change PNG_SRGB_INTENT to PNG_sRGB_INTENT in libpng.txt and libpng.3
version libpng-1.0.5d November 29, 1999
  Add type cast (png_const_charp) two places in png.c
  Eliminated pngtypes.h; use macros instead to declare PNG_CHNK arrays.
  Renamed "PNG_GLOBAL_ARRAYS" to "PNG_USE_GLOBAL_ARRAYS" and made available
    to applications a macro "PNG_USE_LOCAL_ARRAYS".
  #ifdef out all the new declarations when PNG_USE_GLOBAL_ARRAYS is defined.
  Added PNG_EXPORT_VAR macro to accommodate making DLL's.
version libpng-1.0.5e November 30, 1999
  Added iCCP, iTXt, and sPLT support; added "lang" member to the png_text
    structure; refactored the inflate/deflate support to make adding new chunks
    with trailing compressed parts easier in the future, and added new functions
    png_free_iCCP, png_free_pCAL, png_free_sPLT, png_free_text, png_get_iCCP,
    png_get_spalettes, png_set_iCCP, png_set_spalettes (Eric S. Raymond).
  NOTE: Applications that write text chunks MUST define png_text->lang. Before
    calling png_set_text(). It must be set to NULL if you want to write tEXt or
    zTXt chunks.  If you want your application to be able to run with older
    versions of libpng, use

     #ifdef PNG_iTXt_SUPPORTED
        png_text[i].lang = NULL;
     #endif

  Changed png_get_oFFs() and png_set_oFFs() to use signed rather than unsigned
    offsets (Eric S. Raymond).
  Combined PNG_READ_cHNK_SUPPORTED and PNG_WRITE_cHNK_SUPPORTED macros into
    PNG_cHNK_SUPPORTED and combined the three types of PNG_text_SUPPORTED
    macros, leaving the separate macros also available.
  Removed comments on #endifs at the end of many short, non-nested #if-blocks.
version libpng-1.0.5f December 6, 1999
  Changed makefile.solaris to issue a warning about potential problems when
    the ucb "ld" is in the path ahead of the ccs "ld".
  Removed "- [date]" from the "synopsis" line in libpng.3 and libpngpf.3.
  Added sCAL chunk support (Eric S. Raymond).
version libpng-1.0.5g December 7, 1999
  Fixed "png_free_spallettes" typo in png.h
  Added code to handle new chunks in pngpread.c
  Moved PNG_CHNK string macro definitions outside of PNG_NO_EXTERN block
  Added "translated_key" to png_text structure and png_write_iTXt().
  Added code in pngwrite.c to work around a newly discovered zlib bug.
version libpng-1.0.5h December 10, 1999
  NOTE: regarding the note for version 1.0.5e, the following must also
    be included in your code:
        png_text[i].translated_key = NULL;
  Unknown chunk handling is now supported.
  Option to eliminate all floating point support was added.  Some new
    fixed-point functions such as png_set_gAMA_fixed() were added.
version libpng-1.0.5i December 13, 1999
  Added some type casts to silence compiler warnings.
  Renamed "png_free_spalette" to "png_free_spalettes" for consistency.
  Removed leading blanks from a #define in pngvcrd.c
  Added some parameters to the new png_set_keep_unknown_chunks() function,
    and relocated it in pngset.c
  Added a test for up->location != 0 in the first instance of writing
    unknown chunks in pngwrite.c
  Changed "num" to "i" in png_free_spalettes() and png_free_unknowns() to
    prevent recursion.
  Added png_free_hIST() function.
  Various patches to fix bugs in the sCAL and integer cHRM processing,
    and to add some convenience macros for use with sCAL.
version libpng-1.0.5j December 21, 1999
  Changed "unit" parameter of png_write_sCAL from png_byte to int, to work
    around buggy compilers.
  Added new type "png_fixed_point" for integers that hold float*100000 values
  Restored backward compatibility of tEXt/zTXt chunk processing:
    Added members "lang_key" and "itxt_length" to png_text struct.  Set
    text_length=0 when "text" contains iTXt data.  Use the "compression"
    member to distinguish among tEXt/zTXt/iTXt types.  Restored the first
    four members of png_text to the same order as v.1.0.5d.  The "Note" above,
    about backward incompatibility of libpng-1.0.5e, no longer applies.
  Added PNG_ITXT_COMPRESSION_NONE (1) and PNG_ITXT_COMPRESSION_zTXt(2) macros.
  Fixed png_read|write_iTXt() to read|write parameters in the right order.
    and to write the iTXt chunk after IDAT if it appears in the end_ptr.
  Added pnggccrd.c, version of pngvcrd.c Intel assembler for gcc (Greg Roelofs)
  Reversed the order of trying to write floating-point and fixed-point gAMA.
version libpng-1.0.5k December 27, 1999
  Added many parentheses, e.g., "if (a && b & c)" becomes "if (a && (b & c))"
  Added png_handle_as_unknown()
  Added png_free_chunk_list() function and chunk_list and num_chunk_list members
    of png_ptr.
  Eliminated erroneous warnings about multiple sPLT chunks and sPLT-after-PLTE.
  Fixed a libpng-1.0.5h bug in pngrutil.c that was issuing erroneous warnings
    about ignoring incorrect gAMA with sRGB (gAMA was in fact not ignored)
  Added png_free_tRNS(); png_set_tRNS() now malloc's its own trans array (ESR).
  Define png_get_int_32 when oFFs chunk is supported as well as when pCAL is.
  Changed type of proflen from png_int_32 to png_uint_32 in png_get_iCCP().
version libpng-1.0.5l January 1, 2000
  Added functions png_set_read_user_chunk_fn() and png_get_user_chunk_ptr()
    for setting a callback function to handle unknown chunks and for
    retrieving the associated user pointer (Glenn).
version 1.0.5m [January 7, 2000]
  Added high-level functions png_read_png(), png_write_png(), png_free_pixels().
version 1.0.5n [January 9, 2000]
  Added png_free_PLTE() function, and modified png_set_PLTE() to malloc its
    own memory for info_ptr->palette.  This makes it safe for the calling
    application to free its copy of the palette any time after it calls
    png_set_PLTE().
version 1.0.5o [January 20, 2000]
  Cosmetic changes only (removed some trailing blanks and TABs)
version 1.0.5p [January 31, 2000]
  Renamed pngdll.mak to makefile.bd32
  Cosmetic changes in pngtest.c
version 1.0.5q [February 5, 2000]
  Relocated the makefile.solaris warning about PATH problems.
  Fixed pngvcrd.c bug by pushing/popping registers in mmxsupport (Bruce Oberg)
  Revised makefile.gcmmx
  Added PNG_SETJMP_SUPPORTED, PNG_SETJMP_NOT_SUPPORTED, and PNG_ABORT() macros
version 1.0.5r [February 7, 2000]
  Removed superfluous prototype for png_get_itxt from png.h
  Fixed a bug in pngrtran.c that improperly expanded the background color.
  Return *num_text=0 from png_get_text() when appropriate, and fix documentation
    of png_get_text() in libpng.txt/libpng.3.
version 1.0.5s [February 18, 2000]
  Added "png_jmpbuf()" macro to pngconf.h, to help people migrate to the
    new error handler that's planned for the next libpng release, and changed
    example.c, pngtest.c, and contrib programs to use this macro.
  Revised some of the DLL-export macros in pngconf.h (Greg Roelofs)
  Fixed a bug in png_read_png() that caused it to fail to expand some images
    that it should have expanded.
  Fixed some mistakes in the unused and undocumented INCH_CONVERSIONS functions
    in pngget.c
  Changed the allocation of palette, history, and trans arrays back to
    the version 1.0.5 method (linking instead of copying) which restores
    backward compatibility with version 1.0.5.  Added some remarks about
    that in example.c
  Updated makefile.linux and makefile.gccmmx to make directories conditionally.
  Made cosmetic changes to pngasmrd.h
  Added png_set_rows() and png_get_rows(), for use with png_read|write_png().
  Modified png_read_png() to allocate info_ptr->row_pointers only if it
    hasn't already been allocated.
