Changes since the last public release (1.5.5):

Version 1.5.6beta01 [September 22, 2011]
  Fixed some 64-bit type conversion warnings in pngrtran.c
  Moved row_info from png_struct to a local variable.
  The various interlace mask arrays have been made into arrays of
    bytes and made PNG_CONST and static (previously some arrays were
    marked PNG_CONST and some weren't).
  Additional checks have been added to the transform code to validate the
    pixel depths after the transforms on both read and write.
  Removed some redundant code from pngwrite.c, in png_desgtroy_write_struct().
  Changed chunk reading/writing code to use png_uint_32 instead of png_byte[4].
    This removes the need to allocate temporary strings for chunk names on
    the stack in the read/write code.  Unknown chunk handling still uses the
    string form because this is exposed in the API.

Version 1.5.6beta02 [Septhember 26, 2011]
  Added a note in the manual the png_read_update_info() must be called only
    once with a particular info_ptr.
  Fixed a typo in the definition of the new PNG_STRING_FROM_CHUNK(s,c) macro.
