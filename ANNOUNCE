Changes since the last public release (1.4.7):

version 1.4.8beta01 [June 4, 2011]
  Undef "_ALL_SOURCE" for AIX, to prevent "jmpbuf" from being redefined.
  Copied png_debug macros from pngpriv.h into pngtest.c and removed
    "#include pngpriv.h" from pngtest.c, to avoid setting a bad example.
  Pass "" instead of '\0' to png_default_error() in png_err().  This mistake
    was introduced in libpng-1.2.20beta01.
