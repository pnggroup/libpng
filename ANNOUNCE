Changes since the last public release (1.6.2):

Version 1.6.3beta01 [April 25, 2013]
  Revised stack marking in arm/filter_neon.S and configure.ac.
  Ensure that NEON filter stuff is completely disabled when switched 'off'.
    Previously the ARM NEON specific files were still built if the option
    was switched 'off' as opposed to being explicitly disabled.

Version 1.6.3beta02 [April 26, 2013]
  Test for 'arm*' not just 'arm' in the host_cpu configure variable.
  Rebuilt the configure scripts.

Version 1.6.3beta03 [April 30, 2013]
  Expanded manual paragraph about writing private chunks, particularly
    the need to call png_set_keep_unknown_chunks() when writing them.
  Avoid dereferencing NULL pointer possibly returned from
     png_create_write_struct() (Andrew Church).

Version 1.6.3beta05 [May 9, 2013]
  Calculate our own zlib windowBits when decoding rather than trusting the
    CMF bytes in the PNG datastream.
  Added an option to force maximum window size for inflating, which was
    the behavior of libpng15 and earlier.
  Added png-fix-itxt and png-fix-too-far-back to the built programs and
    removed warnings from the source code and timepng that are revealed as
    a result.
  Detect wrong libpng versions linked to png-fix-too-far-back, which currently
    only works with libpng versions that can be made to reliably fail when
    the deflate data contains an out-of-window reference.  This means only
    1.6 and later.
  Fixed gnu issues: g++ needs a static_cast, gcc 4.4.7 has a broken warning
    message which it is easier to work round than ignore.
  Updated contrib/pngminus/pnm2png.c (Paul Stewart):
    Check for EOF
    Ignore "#" delimited comments in input file to pnm2png.c.
    Fixed whitespace handling
    Added a call to png_set_packing()
    Initialize dimension values so if sscanf fails at least we have known
      invalid values.
  Attempt to detect configuration issues with png-fix-too-far-back, which
    requires both the correct libpng and the correct zlib to function
    correctly.
  Check ZLIB_VERNUM for mismatches, enclose #error in quotes
  Added information in the documentation about problems with and fixes for
    the bad CRC and bad iTXt chunk situations.

Version 1.6.3beta06 [May 12, 2013]
  Allow contrib/pngminus/pnm2png.c to compile without WRITE_INVERT and
    WRITE_PACK supported (writes error message that it can't read P1 or
  Improved png-fix-too-far-back usage message, added --suffix option.
  Revised contrib/pngminim/*/makefile to generate pnglibconf.h with the
    right zlib header files.
  Separated CPPFLAGS and CFLAGS in contrib/pngminim/*/makefile

Version 1.6.3beta07 [June 5, 2013]
  Removed a redundant test in png_set_IHDR().
  Added set(CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES ...) to CMakeLists.txt (Andrew Hundt)
  Deleted set(CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE) block from CMakeLists.txt
