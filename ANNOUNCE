Changes since the last public release (1.5.1):

Version 1.5.2beta01 [February 13, 2011]
  More -Wshadow fixes for older gcc compilers.  Older gcc versions apparently
    check formal parameters names in function declarations (as well as
    definitions) to see if they match a name in the global namespace.
  Revised PNG_EXPORTA macro to not use an empty parameter, to accommodate the
    old VisualC++ preprocessor.
  Turned on interlace handling in png_read_png().
  Fixed gcc pendantic warnings.
  Handle longjmp in Cygwin.
  Fixed png_get_current_row_number() in the interlaced case.
  Cleaned up ALPHA flags and transformations.
  Implemented expansion to 16 bits.

Version 1.5.2beta02 [February 19, 2011]
  Fixed mistake in the descriptions of user read_transform and write_transform
    function prototypes in the manual.  The row_info struct is png_row_infop.
  Reverted png_get_current_row_number() to previous (1.5.2beta01) behavior.
  Corrected png_get_current_row_number documentation
  Fixed the read/write row callback documentation.
    This documents the current behavior, where the callback is called after
    every row with information pertaining to the next row.

Version 1.5.2beta03 [February 28, 2011]
  Fixed scripts/makefile.vcwin32
  Updated contrib/pngsuite/README to add the word "modify".
