Libpng 1.2.2beta5 - March 26, 2002

This is not intended to be a public release.  It will be replaced
within a few weeks by a public version or by another test version.

Changes since the last public release (1.2.1):

version 1.2.2beta1 [February 22, 2002]
  Fixed a bug with reading the length of iCCP profiles (Larry Reeves).

  Revised makefile.darwin to remove "-undefined suppress" option.
  Added checks for gamma and chromaticity values over 21474.83, which exceed
    the limit for PNG unsigned 32-bit integers when encoded.
  Revised calls to png_create_read_struct() and png_create_write_struct()
    for simpler debugging.
  Revised png_zalloc() so zlib handles errors (uses PNG_FLAG_MALLOC_NULL_MEM_OK)

  Check chunk_length and idat_size for invalid (over PNG_MAX_UINT) lengths.
  Check for invalid image dimensions in png_get_IHDR.

version 1.2.2beta4 [March 8, 2002]
  Compute background.gray and background_1.gray even when color_type is RGB
    in case image gets reduced to gray later (Jason Summers).
  Relocated a misplaced /bin/rm in the "install-shared" makefile targets
  Added PNG_1_0_X macro which can be used to build a 1.0.x-compatible library.
version 1.2.2beta5 [March 26, 2002]
  Added missing PNGAPI to several function definitions.
  Check for invalid bit_depth or color_type in png_get_IHDR(), and

  Revised iTXt support to accept NULL for lang and lang_key.
  Compute gamma for color components of background even when color_type is gray.
  Changed "()" to "{}" in pkgconfig/libpngNN.pc.
