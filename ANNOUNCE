Changes since the last public release (1.2.34):

version 1.2.35beta01 [February 4, 2009]
  Zero out some arrays of pointers after png_malloc(). (Tavis Ormandy)

version 1.2.35beta02 [Feburary 4, 2009]
  Zero out more arrays of pointers after png_malloc().

version 1.2.35beta03 [February 5, 2009]
  Use png_memset() instead of a loop to intialize pointers.  We realize
    this will not work on platforms where the NULL pointer is not all zeroes.

version 1.2.35rc01 [February 11, 2009]
  No changes.

version 1.2.35rc02 [February 12, 2009]
  Fix typo in new png_memset call in pngset.c (png_color should be png_charp)

version 1.0.43 and 1.2.35 [February 14, 2009]
  No changes.

version 1.2.36beta01 [February 28, 2009]
  Revised comments in png_set_read_fn() and png_set_write_fn().
  Revised order of #ifdef's and indentation in png_debug definitions of png.h
    bug introduced in libpng-1.2.34.

version 1.2.36beta02 [March 21, 2009]
  Use png_memset() after png_malloc() of big_row_buf when reading an
    interlaced file, to avoid a possible UMR.
  Undid recent revision of PNG_NO_STDIO version of png_write_flush().  Users
    having trouble with fflush() can build with PNG_NO_WRITE_FLUSH defined.
  Revised libpng*.txt documentation about use of png_write_flush().
  Removed fflush() from pngtest.c.
  Added "#define PNG_NO_WRITE_FLUSH" to contrib/pngminim/encoder/pngusr.h

version 1.2.36beta03 [March 27, 2009]
  Relocated misplaced PNG_1_0_X define in png.h that caused the prototype
    for png_set_strip_error_numbers() to be omitted from PNG_NO_ASSEMBLER_CODE
    builds.  This bug was introduced in libpng-1.2.15beta4.
  Added a section on differences between 1.0.x and 1.2.x to libpng.3/libpng.txt

version 1.2.36beta04 [April 5, 2009]
  Fixed potential memory leak of "new_name" in png_write_iCCP() (Ralph Giles)

version 1.2.36beta05 [April 13, 2009]
  Added "ifndef PNG_SKIP_SETJMP_CHECK" block in pngconf.h to allow
    application code writers to bypass the check for multiple inclusion
    of setjmp.h when they know that it is safe to ignore the situation.
