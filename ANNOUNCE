Changes since the last public release (1.5.15):

Version 1.5.16beta01 [April 25, 2013]
  Corrected a misplaced closing bracket in contrib/libtests/pngvalid.c
    (Flavio Medeiros).
  Revised stack marking in arm/filter_neon.S and configure.ac
  Ensure that NEON filter stuff is completely disabled when switched 'off'.
    Previously the ARM NEON specific files were still built if the option
    was switched 'off' as opposed to being explicitly disabled.
  Avoid a compiler warning about unused png_ptr in translate_gamma_flags()

Version 1.5.16beta02 [April 26, 2013]
  Revise pngtest.c to skip tests of unsupported features.
  Regenerated configure files.

Version 1.5.16beta03 [April 26, 2013]
