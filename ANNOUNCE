Changes since the last public release (1.5.15):

Version 1.5.16beta01 [April 25, 2013]
  Corrected a misplaced closing bracket in contrib/libtests/pngvalid.c
    (Flavio Medeiros).
  Revised stack marking in arm/filter_neon.S and configure.ac
  Ensure that NEON filter stuff is completely disabled when switched 'off'.
    Previously the ARM NEON specific files were still built if the option
    was switched 'off' as opposed to being explicitly disabled.
  Avoid a compiler warning about unused png_ptr in translate_gamma_flags()

Version 1.5.16beta02 [April 26, 2013]
  Revise pngtest.c to skip tests of unsupported features.
  Regenerated configure files.

Version 1.5.16beta03 [April 26, 2013]
  Test for 'arm*' not just 'arm' in the host_cpu configure variable.

Version 1.5.16beta04 [May 1, 2013]
  Expanded manual paragraph about writing private chunks, particularly
    the need to call png_set_keep_unknown_chunks() when writing them.

Version 1.5.16beta05 [May 9, 2013]
  Updated contrib/pngminus/pnm2png.c (Paul Stewart):
    Check for EOF
    Ignore "#" delimited comments in input file to pnm2png.c.
    Fixed whitespace handling
    Added a call to png_set_packing()
    Initialize dimension values so if sscanf fails at least we have known
      invalid values.

Version 1.5.16beta06 [May 12, 2013]
  Allow contrib/pnminus/pnm2png.c to compile without WRITE_INVERT and WRITE_PACK
    supported (writes error message that it can't read P1 or P4 PBM files).
  Revised contrib/pngminim/*/makefile to separate CPPFLAGS and CPFLAGS, and
    to generate pnglibconf.h with the right zlib header files.
  Ported contrib/pngminus/pnm2png.c changes back from libpng-1.6.3beta06,
    to use unsigned long, not png_uint_32 arguments to sscanf().
