    linewrapping that it entailed.

    the libpng license.
  Changed PNG_INTERNAL to PNG_EXPOSE_INTERNAL_STRUCTURES
  Removed the cbuilder5 project, which has not been updated to 1.4.0.

version 1.5.0beta08 [February 19, 2010]
  Changed #ifdef PNG_NO_STDIO_SUPPORTED to #ifdef PNG_NO_CONSOLE_IO_SUPPORTED

version 1.5.0beta13 [March 9, 2010]
  Protect pngstruct.h, pnginfo.h, and pngdebug.h from being included twice.
  Revise the "#ifdef" blocks in png_inflate() so it will compile when neither

    is defined.
  Removed unused png_measure_compressed_chunk() from pngpriv.h and libpngpf.3
  Moved the 'config.h' support from pngconf.h to pngpriv.h
