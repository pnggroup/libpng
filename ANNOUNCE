  No changes.

version 1.2.34beta01 [November 27, 2008]
  Revised png_warning() to write its message on standard output by default

  Fixed string vs pointer-to-string error in png_check_keyword().
  Added png_check_cHRM_fixed() in png.c and moved checking from pngget.c,
    pngrutil.c, and pngwrite.c, and eliminated floating point cHRM checking.
  Added check for zero-area RGB cHRM triange in png_check_cHRM_fixed().
  In png_check_cHRM_fixed(), ensure white_y is > 0, and removed redundant
    check for all-zero coordinates that is detected by the triangle check.
  Revised png_warning() to write its message on standard output by default
    when warning_fn is NULL.

version 1.2.34beta02 [November 28, 2008]
  Corrected off-by-one error in bKGD validity check in png_write_bKGD()
    and in png_handle_bKGD().

version 1.2.34beta02 [December 1, 2008]
  Revised bKGD validity check to use >= x instead of > x + 1
  Merged with png_debug from libpng-1.4.0 to remove newlines.
