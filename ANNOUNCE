Changes since the last public release (1.5.9):

Version 1.5.10beta01 [February 21, 2012]
  Removed two useless #ifdef directives from pngread.c and one from pngrutil.c
  Always put the CMAKE_LIBRARY in "lib" (removed special WIN32 case).
  Removed empty vstudio/pngstest directory (Clifford Yapp).
  Eliminated redundant png_push_read_tEXt|zTXt|iTXt|unknown code from
    pngpread.c and use the sequential png_handle_tEXt, etc., in pngrutil.c;
    now that png_ptr->buffer is inaccessible to applications, the special
    handling is no longer useful.
  Fixed bug with png_handle_hIST with odd chunk length (Frank Busse).
