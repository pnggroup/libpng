Changes since the last public release (1.5.1):

Version 1.5.2beta01 [February 12, 2011]
  More -Wshadow fixes for older gcc compilers.  Older gcc versions apparently
    check formal parameters names in function declarations (as well as
    definitions) to see if they match a name in the global namespace.
  Changed empty parameter to PNG_BLANK in PNG_EXPORTA definition to
    accommodate the old VisualC++ preprocessor.
  Defined PNG_ALLOCATED to empty for MSC_VER < 1300.
