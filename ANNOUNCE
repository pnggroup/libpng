Changes since the last public release (1.2.18):

version 1.2.19beta1 [May 18, 2007]
  Changed "const static" to "static PNG_CONST" everywhere, mostly undoing
    change of libpng-1.2.17beta2.  Changed other "const" to "PNG_CONST"

version 1.2.19beta2 [May 18, 2007]
  Fixed png_do_expand() to only use the appropriate bits of tRNS value.

version 1.2.19beta3 [May 20, 2007]
  Add some "png_byte" typecasts in png_check_keyword().
  Write new_key instead of key in zTXt chunk.

version 1.2.19beta4 [May 21, 2007]
  Add png_snprintf() function and use it in place of sprint() for improved
    defense against buffer overflows.

version 1.2.19beta5 [May 21, 2007]
  Fixed png_handle_tRNS() to only use the appropriate bits of tRNS value.
  Changed handling of more unused parameters, to avoid compiler warnings.
  Removed some PNG_CONST in pngwutil.c to avoid compiler warnings.

version 1.2.19beta6 [May 22, 2007]
  Added some #ifdef PNG_MMX_CODE_SUPPORTED where needed in pngvcrd.c
  Added a special "_MSC_VER" case that defines png_snprintf to _snprintf

version 1.2.19beta7 [May 22, 2007]
  Squelched png_squelch_warnings() in pnggccrd.c and added an
    #ifdef PNG_MMX_CODE_SUPPORTED block around the declarations that caused
    the warnings that png_squelch_warnings was squelching.

version 1.2.19beta8 [May 22, 2007]
  Removed __MMX__ from test in pngconf.h.
