Changes since the last public release (1.2.41):

version 1.2.42beta01 [December 4, 2009]
  Removed "#define PNG_NO_ERROR_NUMBERS" that was inadvertently added
    to pngconf.h in version 1.2.41.
  Revised scripts/makefile.netbsd, makefile.openbsd, and makefile.sco
    to put png.h and pngconf.h in $prefix/include, like the other scripts,
    instead of in $prefix/include/libpng.  Also revised makefile.sco
    to put them in $prefix/include/libpng%NN% instead of in
    $prefix/include/libpng/libpng%NN%.
  Removed leftover "-DPNG_CONFIGURE_LIBPNG" from scripts/makefile.darwin

version 1.2.42beta02 [December 11, 2009]
  Removed leftover "-DPNG_CONFIGURE_LIBPNG" from contrib/pngminim/*/makefile
  Relocated png_do_chop() to its original position in pngrtran.c. The
    change in version 1.2.41beta08 caused transparency to be handled wrong
    in some 16-bit datastreams (Yusaku Sugai).

version 1.2.42rc01 [December 17, 2009]
  No changes.
