Changes since the last public release (1.5.4):

Version 1.5.5beta01 [July 13, 2011]
  Fixed some typos and made other minor changes in the manual.
  Updated contrib/pngminus/makefile.std (Samuli Souminen)

Version 1.5.5beta02 [July 14, 2011]
  Revised Makefile.am and Makefile.in to look in the right directory for
    pnglibconf.h.prebuilt

Version 1.5.5beta03 [July 27, 2011]
  Enabled compilation with g++ compiler.  This compiler does not recognize
    the file extension, so it always compiles with C++ rules.  Made minor
    changes to pngrutil.c to cast results where C++ expects it but C does not.
  Minor editing of libpng.3 and libpng-manual.txt.

Version 1.5.5beta04 [July 29, 2011]
  Revised CMakeLists.txt (Clifford Yapp)
  Updated commentary about the png_rgb_to_gray() default coefficients
    in the manual and in pngrtran.c
