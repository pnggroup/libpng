Changes since the last public release (1.5.6):

Version 1.5.7beta01 [November 4, 2011]
  Added support for ARM processor (Mans Rullgard)
  Fixed bug in pngvalid on early allocation failure; fixed type cast in
    pngmem.c; pngvalid would attempt to call png_error() if the allocation
    of a png_struct or png_info failed. This would probably have led to a
    crash.  The pngmem.c implementation of png_malloc() included a cast
    to png_size_t which would fail on large allocations on 16-bit systems.
  Fix for the preprocessor of the Intel C compiler. The preprocessor
    splits adjacent @ signs with a space; this changes the concatentation
    token from @-@-@ to PNG_JOIN; that should work with all compiler
    preprocessors.
  Paeth filter speed improvements from work by Siarhei Siamashka. This
    changes the 'Paeth' reconstruction function to improve the GCC code
    generation on x86. The changes are only part of the suggested ones;
    just the changes that definitely improve speed and remain simple.
    The changes also slightly increase the clarity of the code.

Version 1.5.7beta02 [November 11, 2011]
  Check compression_type parameter in png_get_iCCP and remove spurious
    casts. The compression_type parameter is always assigned to, so must
    be non-NULL. The cast of the profile length potentially truncated the
    value unnecessarily on a 16-bit int system, so the cast of the (byte)
    compression type to (int) is specified by ANSI-C anyway.
  Fixed FP division by zero in pngvalid.c; the 'test_pixel' code left
    the sBIT fields in the test pixel as 0, which resulted in a floating
    point division by zero which was irrelevant but causes systems where
    FP exceptions cause a crash. Added code to pngvalid to turn on FP
    exceptions if the appropriate glibc support is there to ensure this is
    tested in the future.
  Updated scripts/pnglibconf.mak and scripts/makefile.std to handle the
    new PNG_JOIN macro.
  Added versioning to pnglibconf.h comments.
  Simplified read/write API initial version; basic read/write tested on
    a variety of images, limited documentation (in the header file.)
  Installed more accurate linear to sRGB conversion tables. The slightly
    modified tables reduce the number of 16-bit values that
    convert to an off-by-one 8-bit value.  The "makesRGB.c" code that was used
    to generate the tables is now in a contrib/sRGBtables sub-directory.

Version 1.5.7beta03 [November 16, 2011]
  Removed PNG_CONST from the sRGB table declarations in pngpriv.h and png.c
  Added run-time detection of NEON support.
  Added contrib/libtests; includes simplified API test and timing test and
    a color conversion utility for rapid checking of failed 'pngstest' results.
