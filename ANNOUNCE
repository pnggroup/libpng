Changes since the last public release (1.6.20):

Version 1.6.21beta01 [December 14, 2015]
  Fixed syntax "$(command)" in tests/pngstest that some shells other than
    bash could not parse (Bug report by Nelson Beebe). Use `command` instead.
  Moved png_check_keyword() from pngwutil.c to pngset.c
  Removed LE/BE dependencies in pngvalid, to 'fix' the current problem
    in the BigEndian tests by not testing it, making the BE code the same 
    as the LE version.
  Fixes to pngvalid for various reduced build configurations (eliminate unused
    statics) and a fix for the case in rgb_to_gray when the digitize option
    reduces graylo to 0, producing a large error.
