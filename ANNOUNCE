Changes since the last public release (1.6.25):

Version 1.6.26beta01 [September 3, 2016]
  Fixed handling zero length IDAT in pngfix (bug report by Agostino Sarubbo,
    bugfix by John Bowler).
  Do not issue a png_error() on read in png_set_pCAL() because png_handle_pCAL
    has allocated memory that libpng needs to free.
