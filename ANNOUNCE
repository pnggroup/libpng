Changes since the last public release (1.2.42):

version 1.2.43beta01 [January 27, 2010]
  Updated CMakeLists.txt for consistent indentation and to avoid an
    unclosed if-statement warning (Philip Lowman).
  Removed "#ifdef PNG_1_0_X / #endif" surrounding
    PNG_READ_16_TO_8_SUPPORTED and PNG_READ_GRAY_TO_RGB_SUPPORTED
    in pngconf.h.  These were added in libpng-1.2.41beta08 and libpng-1.0.51,
    which introduced a binary incompatibility with libpng-1.0.50.
  Backported new png_decompress_chunk() algorithm from libpng-1.4.1

version 1.2.43beta02 [February 1, 2010]
  Backported two-pass png_decompress_chunk() algorithm from libpng-1.4.1

version 1.2.43beta03 [February 6, 2010]
  Backported fast png_push_save_buffer() algorithm from libpng-1.4.1

version 1.2.43beta04 [February 8, 2010]
  Reverted recent changes to png_push_save-buffer().
  Removed PNGAPI declaration of png_calloc() and png_write_sig() in
    1ibpng-1.2.X, introduced by mistake in libpng-1.2.41.
  Return allocated "old_buffer" in png_push_save_buffer() before png_error(),
    to avoid a potential memory leak.

version 1.2.43beta05 [February 8, 2010]
  Ported rewritten png_decompress_chunk() by John Bowler from libpng-1.4.1.

version 1.0.53rc01 and 1.2.43rc01 [February 18, 2010]
  No changes.

version 1.0.53rc02 and 1.2.43rc02 [February 19, 2010]
  Define _ALL_SOURCE in configure.ac, makefile.aix, and CMakeLists.txt
    when using AIX compiler.

  Removed unused gzio.c from contrib/pngminim gather and makefile scripts

version 1.2.44beta01 [June 18, 2010]
  In pngpread.c: png_push_have_row() add check for new_row > height
  Removed the now-redundant check for out-of-bounds new_row from example.c

version 1.2.44beta02 [June 19, 2010]
  In pngpread.c: png_push_process_row() add check for too many rows.
  Removed the now-redundant check for new_row > height in png_push_have_row().

version 1.2.44beta03 [June 20, 2010]
  Rewrote png_process_IDAT_data to consistently treat extra data as warnings
    and handle end conditions more cleanly.
  Removed the new (beta02) check in png_push_process_row().

version 1.2.44rc01 [June 21, 2010]
  Revised some comments in png_process_IDAT_data().

version 1.2.44rc02 [June 22, 2010]
  Stop memory leak when reading a malformed sCAL chunk.

version 1.2.44rc03 [June 23, 2010]
  Revised pngpread.c patch of beta05 to avoid an endless loop.

version 1.2.44 [June 26, 2010]
  Updated some of the "last changed" dates.

version 1.2.45beta01 [June 7, 2011]
  Fixed 1-byte uninitialized memory reference in png_format_buffer() (Bug
    report by Frank Busse, related to CVE-2004-0421).
  Pass "" instead of '\0' to png_default_error() in png_err().  This mistake
    was introduced in libpng-1.2.20beta01.
  Check for up->location !PNG_AFTER_IDAT when writing unknown chunks
    before IDAT.

  Check for integer overflow in png_set_rgb_to_gray().
