Changes since the last public release (1.6.16):

Version 1.6.17beta01 [January 13, 2015]
  Removed duplicate PNG_SAFE_LIMITS_SUPPORTED handling from pngconf.h
  Corrected the width limit calculation in png_check_IHDR().
  Removed user limits from pngfix. Also pass NULL pointers to
    png_read_row to skip the unnecessary row de-interlace stuff.
  Added testing of png_set_packing() to pngvalid.c
  Regenerated configure scripts in the *.tar distributions with libtool-2.4.4
  Implement previously untested cases of libpng transforms in pngvalid.c
  Fixed byte order in 2-byte filler, in png_do_read_filler().
  Made the check for out-of-range values in png_set_tRNS() detect
    values that are exactly 2^bit_depth, and work on 16-bit platforms.
