Changes since the last public release (1.6.21):

Version 1.6.22beta01 [January 23, 2016]
  Changed PNG_USE_MKSTEMP to __COVERITY__ to select alternate
    "tmpfile()" implementation in contrib/libtests/pngstest.c
  Fixed NO_STDIO build of pngunknown.c to skip calling png_init_io()
    if there is no stdio.h support.
  Added a png_image_write_to_memory() API and a number of assist macros
    to allow an application that uses the simplified API write to bypass
    stdio and write directly to memory.
  Added some warnings (png.h) and some check code to detect *possible*
    overflow in the ROW_STRIDE and simplified image SIZE macros.  This
    disallows image width/height/format that *might* overflow.  This is
    a quiet API change that limits in-memory image size (uncompressed) to
    less than 4GByte and image row size (stride) to less than 2GByte.
  Revised workaround for false-positive Coverity issue in pngvalid.c.

Version 1.6.22beta02 [January 29, 2016]
  Only use exit(77) in configure builds.
  Corrected error in PNG_IMAGE_PNG_SIZE_MAX. This new macro underreported
    the palette size because it failed to take into account that the memory
    palette has to be expanded to full RGB when it is written to PNG.
  Updated CMakeLists.txt, added supporting scripts/gen*.cmake.in
    and test.cmake.in (Roger Leigh).
