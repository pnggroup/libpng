Changes since the last public release (1.6.19):

Version 1.6.20beta01 [November 20, 2015]
  Avoid potential pointer overflow/underflow in png_handle_sPLT() and
    png_handle_pCAL() (Bug report by John Regehr).

Version 1.6.20beta02 [November 23, 2015]
  Fixed incorrect implementation of png_set_PLTE() that uses png_ptr
    not info_ptr, that left png_set_PLTE() open to the CVE-2015-8126
    vulnerability.

Version 1.6.20beta03 [November 29, 2015]
  Backported tests from libpng-1.7.0beta69.
 
Version 1.6.20rc01 [November 29, 2015]
  Fixed an error in handling of bad zlib CMINFO field in pngfix, found by
    American Fuzzy Lop, reported by Brian Carpenter.  inflate() doesn't
    immediately fault a bad CMINFO field; instead a 'too far back' error
    happens later (at least some times).  pngfix failed to limit CMINFO to
    the allowed values but then assumed that window_bits was in range,
    triggering an assert. The bug is mostly harmless; the PNG file cannot
    be fixed.
