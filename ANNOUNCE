Changes since the last public release (1.5.0):

version 1.5.1beta01 [January 8, 2011]
  Added description of png_set_crc_action() to the manual.
  Added a note in the manual that the type of the iCCP profile was changed
    from png_charpp to png_bytepp in png_get_iCCP().  This change happened
    in version 1.5.0beta36 but is not noted in the CHANGES.  Similarly,
    it was changed from png_charpp to png_const_bytepp in png_set_iCCP().
  Ensure that png_rgb_to_gray ignores palette mapped images,
  Fixed the failure to handle palette mapped images correctly.

Version 1.5.1beta02 [January 14, 2011]
  Fixed a bug in handling of interlaced images (bero at arklinux.org).
  Updated CMakeLists.txt (Clifford Yapp)

Version 1.5.1beta03 [January 14, 2011]
  Fixed typecasting of some png_debug() statements (Cosmin)

Version 1.5.1beta04 [January 16, 2011]
  Updated documentation of png_set|get_tRNS() (Thomas Klausner).
  Mentioned in the documentation that applications must #include "zlib.h"
    if they need access to anything in zlib.h, and that a number of
    macros such as png_memset() are no longer accessible by applications.
  Corrected pngvalid gamma test "sample" function to access all of the color
    samples of each pixel, instead of sampling the red channel three times.
  Prefixed variable names index, div, exp, gamma with "png_" to avoid "shadow"
    warnings.
  Revised png_fixed() in png.c to avoid compiler warning about reaching the
    end without returning anything.

Version 1.5.1beta05 [January 16, 2011]
  Changed variable names png_index, png_div, png_exp, and png_gamma to
    char_index, divisor, exp_b10, and gamma_val, respectively, and
    changed exp() back to png_exp().

Version 1.5.1beta06 [January 16, 2011]
  Prevent png_push_crc_skip() from hanging while reading an unknown chunk
    or an over-large compressed zTXT chunk with the progressive reader.
