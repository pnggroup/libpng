Known bugs in libpng-1.0.10

1. April 1, 2001: Missing type casts on png_malloc() calls (Dimitri Papadopolous)

   A call to png_malloc() in pngread.c is missing the (png_bytep) type cast,
   and four calls in pngset.c are missing type casts, (png_charp), (png_charp),
   (png_bytep), and (png_bytep), respectively.

   STATUS: fixed in libpng-1.0.11beta1.

2. April 3, 2001: "//" comments cause the SGI compiler (o32) to fail to
   compile pnggccrd.c (Richard Kettlewell).

   STATUS: fixed in libpng-1.0.11beta1.

3. April 5, 2001: The prototypes don't match several functions.

   Functions png_info_init, png_zalloc, and several others have PNGAPI
   in the C functions but not in the prototypes in png.h.  The functions
   involved are all either deprecated or intended only for internal use.

   STATUS: PNGAPI was removed from the C code in libpng-1.0.11beta2.

4. April 14, 2001: Many instances of png_malloc() are not followed by
   a check to make sure it didn't return NULL.

   STATUS: tests were added in libpng-1.0.11beta3.
